Actually, I comment the fork that I've put in the main (this fork is very
usefull cause all my errors use exit to break the process)
maybe it is not very nice, so can we speak about that ?

/!\ you can test the minishell with the sh quick_tester.sh /!\
usage: sh quick_tester.sh "echo \"jag talar inte svenska\" > /dev/null | cat -e"
/!\ yes, you have to add '\' before quotes ;) as our pretty minishell ;) /!\

if you want to just see the ast result, a bin named print_ast is here for you
(its a version of the minishell that's just printing the ast in the terminal and
that's gen a tree.dot file). The tree.dot should be use with the following
command line: dot -Tpng tree.dot -o tree.png && open tree.png
but you can uncomment this line already present on the sh ;)


this is a save of the sh:
/---------------------------------------------------------\
#! /bin/bash

rm -f tree.png
rm -f tree.dot
make\
&& (echo "$1" ; echo "exit") | ./minishell \
# && dot -Tpng tree.dot -o tree.png && open tree.png

Have a good morning ;) (ok.. no one say that ...)

See ya !
